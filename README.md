Objective

The project aims to create an interactive web application to visualize and simulate the working of a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) communication system. It enables users to explore CDMA's key concepts like spreading codes, signal modulation, and multi-user detection, while providing performance metrics like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER).
